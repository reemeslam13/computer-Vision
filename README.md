# Introduction 
In this course we learned The basic concepts of Image Processing and essential concepts to device good vision algorithms. I did small assignments to apply concepts we learned on different images.

# How it works ?
Run the project on Xcode c++. Simply I take as an input an image and apply some vision changes.
